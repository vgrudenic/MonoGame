### WORK IN PROGRESS
Note that the MonoGame documentation project is currently a work in progress and applies to the **latest development build** of MonoGame.

If you are looking for documentation on previous releases of MonoGame you can reference our [GitHub wiki](http://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki) and the original [Codeplex documentation](http://monogame.codeplex.com/documentation) while we're getting this all sorted out.

 
This page describes new API features which is available in current development release.
